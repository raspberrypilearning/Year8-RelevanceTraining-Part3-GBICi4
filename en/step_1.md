## Part 3: 'Relevance' training â€“ Investigating App Lab
Part 3 introduces you to the remainder of the Relevance resources, which focus on App Lab. There are five tasks in this part. In the second and third tasks, you will focus on completing a series of sessions on App Lab that the students themselves will undertake.

## Task 1: Technical setup for the trial

Before you begin developing your skills in App Lab, you need to check that you and your classroom are prepared for the trial. This task, Task 1, aims to ensure that the technical setup is arranged well in advance of delivering the lessons, as you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware.

**Devices:** App Lab is an online tool that runs on desktop computers, but not on tablets or iPad. Check that App Lab runs on each device that you are planning to use in the trial.

**Setting up App Lab logins:** Follow the [Guide to setting up App Lab logins](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16kGy9bQcxId-_Ean0yE-pMG4569MvLk0Ul-p3gGJYJ4){:target="_blank"} for you and your students.

**Seating plan:** When creating the seating plan, you should consider the practicalities of live demonstrations and group discussions. For all activities in these sessions, students will work in teams, getting into groups for discussion and idea development purposes.

Ideally, all demonstrations of programming should be done live, as there are real benefits for the learner. Demonstrations offer students the opportunity to experience how to navigate the App Lab interface and how to interact with it to select and interlock blocks. If live demonstrations are not practical, each session, where relevant, offers students a step-by-step guide. In the following two tasks, you will complete a series of sessions on App Lab to build your expertise and confidence.
