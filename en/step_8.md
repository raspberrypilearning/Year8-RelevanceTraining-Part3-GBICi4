## Task 6: Post-training webinar

The 'Storytelling' post-training webinar was based on the information in this task. Even if you attended the post-training webinar, it is recommended that you work your way through the embedded video recording and/or slide deck to remind yourself of the key questions, the FAQs (frequently asked questions), the feedback mechanisms, and how to engage with the trial community.
