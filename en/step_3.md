## Task 3: Build your app

In this task, you will create your own simple app, with user interaction, which addresses a real-world problem.

With the guidance of the teacher slides and student worksheets in [Session 10](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/107u8trkuSO_QXWtNrEoCAmp4Ppkc2Jvl?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, now build your app.

Leave yourself plenty of exploration and development time to realise your app idea into a working app. Note that the optional Session 11 offers your students additional time to build their apps. In Session 12, students complete building their app.

In the next step, you will share your app with your peers for feedback, as well as sharing it with the Gender Balance in Computing research team. You will also use your app as an example when delivering the trial to students.
