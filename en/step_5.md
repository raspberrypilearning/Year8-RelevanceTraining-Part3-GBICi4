## Task 5: Post-training webinar

The information in this task formed the basis of the 'Relevance' post-training webinar. Even if you attended the post-training webinar, it is recommended that you work your way through the video recording and/or slide deck to remind yourself of the key questions, the FAQs (frequently asked questions), the feedback mechanisms, and how to engage with the trial community. 

Once you have finished, don't forget to complete the survey in the next step to let us know you have completed the course.
